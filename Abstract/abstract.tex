LHCb will undergo a major upgrade for Run 3 of the LHC starting in 2021. This upgrade will see a 5 times luminosity increase to \(2\times10^{33} cm^{-2} s^{-1}\) and the removal of the L0 hardware trigger, increasing the event rate frequency from 1MHz to the full 40MHz event rate of the LHC. A new VELO (Vertex Locator) is also being installed as part of the upgrade. The new detector will feature pixel sensors and will utilise a 40MHz readout to capture information about all events in LHCb. Software for the upgraded VELO will be required to give efficiency's at least comparable to the current VELO, but also operate at a much higher speed with an increased data rate. It is hoped modern hardware such as GPU's (graphical processing units) and parallel software including machine learning techniques will provide the high performance required.

This report will describe progress made this year into my project. Results of  experimentation into different techniques.
